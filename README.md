The App was started with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

todolist requires:

### [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) for styling

### [bulma](https://bulma.io/) for some easy to use styled elements

### [shortid](https://github.com/dylang/shortid#readme) for generating todos' id
