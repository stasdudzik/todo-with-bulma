- app uses local storage persisting the list on a refresh

The App was started with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

todolist requires:

### [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) for styling

### [bulma](https://bulma.io/) for some easy to use styled elements
